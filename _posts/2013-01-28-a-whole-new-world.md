So, here we are. A new year can only mean one thing: a new Real-time project.

Following the success of last year's multi-faceted mind-controlled puzzle game, [Zen Trials](http://benashman.co.uk/edu/zt-all-in-your-head/), we initially thought that a sequel might be the way to go for this six-week project.

There were all sorts of ides being thrown aroundâ€¦ multiplayer, dome (IVT) support, an actual narrative and a tropical island setting not unlike that found in the far inferior Crysis series.
