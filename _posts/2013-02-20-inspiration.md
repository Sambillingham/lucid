Prior to its current development the second half of our experiment, *the challenge*, underwent many heartbreaking iterations. The revision closest to the final concept was essentially the sum of our individual pursuits:

- *"I want to explore the achievability of making pseudo-generative environments within Unity using our data as parameters and giving people the ability to explore (see  [Bad Trip](http://www.polygon.com/2012/10/29/3571480/bad-trip) and the lovingly-crafted indie first-person-island-synthesizer [Proteus](http://www.visitproteus.com))."*

- *"I want to create something with a [collaborative element](http://gamasutra.com/view/news/172002/Molyneux_unveils_Curiosity_a_social_experiment_with_77K_inapp_purchase.php#.USd23aWDShg), a game-like experience that features an array of puzzles whereby the hints cannot be found within the experience itself and would get people to share their insights with each other."*

- *"I want to make an iOS app that works and looks gorgeous! Preferably it would also make use of a sophisticated algorithm and does more than we want the users to believe it does."*

- *"I want to do something crazy in the dome, using [biofeedback sensing technology](http://vimeo.com/m/57979514)."*

## Building Dreamland

Designing a [Surrealist dream world](http://blog.iso50.com/30810/bryan-olson-aka-glass-planet/) is pretty much the ballpit equivalent for every game environment modeller. You will literally not run out of ideas and you might spend hours building an area where [everything is made of candy floss](http://www.homecrux.com/2013/02/08/3761/padded-cell-is-fairytale-home-made-of-pink-candy-floss.html) but it doesn't fit in with any other aspect of the environment stylistically. A common theme was needed other than just dreams, like the *Land of Cockaigne* or maybe a [theme park setting](http://www.gamasutra.com/view/feature/3186/environmental_storytelling_.php).

From back when we were still exploring the possibilities of having the player relive a deterministic sequence of common  dreams we introduced the concept of the *hotel lobby*, a central hub that leads to a corridor of numbered dream rooms. Breaking up the game world into rooms would not only ease the development dramatically, but would also inform a lot of design choices as we were now dealing with something more concrete, man-made and of course interior.

After we settled on making a single-player experience with the focus on the dome environmentit dawned upon us that the only way our game should be experienced was once. With that finiteness came the whole idea of the recruitment process, which would then dictate the world's parcour-like layout and would give us more ways of fleshing out the space with more meaningful geometry (like hinting at areas out of your reach to make it feel less linear).

For the adventurous of you, here is a curated set of [sketches depicting the world of Lucid](https://dl.dropbox.com/u/998319/DAT/Lucid_design_document.pdf).

## Developing a Visual Style

For visuals we mostly inspired each other during the process. Initially when I told Ben to make me some textures  with *"dystopian [art déco grandeur](http://www.creativereview.co.uk/cr-blog/2013/february/poster-art-150) and a dash of [communist propaganda](http://www.examiner.com/images/blog/wysiwyg/image/communist-party-poster.jpg)"* he produced what from then on was known as the Lucid logo. Ben's simple geometric style, in combination with several examples of [minimalist architecture](http://www.behance.net/gallery/THE-MINIMALIST/5708129) then influenced the design of the lobby and so on and so forth.

Only Luke and I were brave enough to build in the third dimension and since he had not touched a 3D package in years we decided to go for plain minimal geometry and only use textures where necessary.
